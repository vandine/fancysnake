This is a modified game of snake I wrote early in my python career. 
I modified the script to make it a bit more visually pleasing, and
to add some more interesting elements to the game, such as the ability
to increase game speed by pressing "+" and decrease the speed by pressing "-".
Along with these features, I also incorporated various color schemes
into the game. The game colors can be changed by pressing the numbers
1 through 8 on.
